# use-a11y

use-a11y are React hooks containing the rules and logic from this section of the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#intro).

Many popular component libraries are great and contain accessible components, but don't lend themselves nicely to highly customized components and designs. Removing the components completely and containing those accessible attributes in hooks gives us full control over the designs and styles of our components.

## Development

- `npm run build:watch`
- `npm link`
- `cd ./examples && npm link use-a11y`
- `npm run storybook`
